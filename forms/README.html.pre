<H1>Authentication of Usenet Group Changes</H1>

<P>This document addresses a method for the authentication of the special
types of Usenet articles that are used to maintain the namespace of
Usenet groups.  A basic familiarity with what the Usenet control
message types "newgroup", "rmgroup" and "checkgroups" do is assumed;
this is not a tutorial in namespace administration.</P>

<P>Usenet articles are notoriously easy to forge, and control messages
are no exception.  Since administrators often want to have their news
systems automatically honor requests from some particular people to
add or remove newsgroups, it is risky to trust the From: and Sender:
headers to identify the real sender of a message, as has historically
been done.  Thus a system using Philip Zimmerman's 
<A HREF="#Getting PGP">Pretty Good Privacy</A>&#174
(PGP&#174 ) was developed to provide a more secure means
of authenticating the sender of a control message.</P>

<P>Unlike traditional PGP authentication of messages, which just
verifies that the contents of the body of a message are unchanged from
when it was digitally "signed", this system also needed to sign a few
headers of the control message to verify the action to be taken and
to guard against certain other pitfalls.  Another goal was to make the
signature as unobtrusive as possible and require minimal changes to
existing software in order to work.</P>

<H2>How to Verify Control Messages</H2>

<P>Listed below are the steps you need to take to enable PGP
authentication of control messages on your system.</P>

<P>Here is the short and simple version for someone who feels confident
hacking around the news system and doesn't like to read a lot:</P>

<OL>
<LI>Get and configure the software:

<DD>Use the action <B>verify-<I>pgp_userid</I></B> (possibly appended
<B>=<I>logfile</I></B>) in <I>control.ctl</I>.
<DT>C News:
<DD>Use the action <B>p</B> in the fourth field of <I>controlperm</I>
followed by a suitable <I>pgp_userid</I> in the fifth field.
<DT>D News:
<DD>Use the action <B>doit,pgp</B> in <I>control.conf</I>.
<DT>ANU News:
<DD>Use the <B>HELP ADD FILE PGP_verification</B> ANU command.
<DT>Other systems:
<DD>Sorry, not implemented yet.
</DL>
<LI>Test <I>pgpverify</I>.
If you have the news.announce.newgroups key in your key ring, run
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.isc.org/pub/pgpcontrol/sample.control">
ftp://ftp.isc.org/pub/pgpcontrol/sample.control</A>
through <I>pgpverify</I> on stdin.  It should spit out the
string "news.announce.newgroups" on stdout.
</OL>

<P>Here is a more verbose version of the instructions:</P>

<P>
<OL>
<LI>
Get the software.

<P>There are two pieces of code that will need to be added to a news
server to make use of this authentication system: a stand-alone
script that verifies an article is what it says it is, and a
patch to hook it into the news server's processing of control messages.</P>

<P>The stand-alone program, 
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.isc.org/pub/pgpcontrol/pgpverify">
ftp://ftp.isc.org/pub/pgpcontrol/pgpverify</A>,
is a
<A HREF="#Getting Perl">Perl</A>
script that should work with Perl version 4 and up.  (I have not tested
it with earlier versions.)  It does not contain any code making it
dependent on any particular news server software.</P>

<P>
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.isc.org/pub/pgpcontrol/server-patches/">
ftp://ftp.isc.org/pub/pgpcontrol/server-patches/</A>
has patches for hooking the system into existing news server software.
Choose the one for your system from the list below.</P>

</UL>

<P>Newer versions of INN (since 1.5), D News and ANU News (since 6.2.0)
do not need to be patched, as they ship with built-in handling for pgp
verification.  You can therefore skip past the "Install it on your
news system" section to "Enable verification for the hierarchies that
interest you".  I recommend that you upgrade to <I>at least</I>
INN 1.5.1sec if you
are running any prior INN version, because it has a few important
security problems fixed.</P>

<P>I regret that I do not have the time to develop more patches, but I
will gladly add patches for other systems to this page as they are
made available to me.  The INN version 1.4sec patch will apply to
all INN "unoff" versions, albeit with a little bit of fuzz.  I am not
positive what versions of C News will work with the C News CR.G
patch; if you try it with other versions, please let me know how it goes.</P>

<LI>
Install it in your news system.

<P>First you must ensure that the absolute paths to <I>perl</I> and to
<I>pgp</I> are correct in the first few lines of the <I>pgpverify</I>
program.  No other configuration of options or pathnames should be
needed.</P>

<P>Next, the following steps assume, solely for the sake of making it
easy for me to write a simple recipe, that you have copied
<I>pgpverify</I> and the patch for your system to your news server as
<I>/tmp/pgpverify</I> and <I>/tmp/pgpcontrol.pch</I> respectively.  I
have tried to format this so that you should be able to cut and paste
any of the lines in italics directly to your shell.</P>

<P>
<UL>
<LI>If you are running INN:

<PRE>
cd to the executable program directory that has <I>ctlinnd</I>.
<I>mv /tmp/pgpverify pgpverify</I>

cd to the root of your INN source tree.
<I>cd site</I>
<I>patch &lt /tmp/pgpcontrol.pch</I>
<I>make install</I>
</PRE>

<P>It has been reported to me that at least one AIX system has problems
with <I>patch</I> not applying the last section of
<I>parsecontrol.pch</I>.  If you run AIX, double check it and apply by
manually editing, if necessary.</P>

<LI>If you are running C News:

<PRE>
cd to the C News program directory that has <I>spacefor</I>.
<I>mv /tmp/pgpverify pgpverify</I>

cd to the root of your C News source tree.
<I>cd ctl</I>
<I>patch &lt /tmp/pgpcontrol.pch</I>
<I>make install</I>
</PRE>

<LI>If you are running some other system:

<P>You're out of luck until someone writes a patch and instructions for
your system and makes it available to me for redistribution.</P>
</UL>

<LI>
Enable verification for the hierarchies that interest you.

<P>To verify messages, you must have a 
<A HREF="#Keys">PGP public key for each signer</A>
that you wish to trust.  It should be entered in a key ring that is
accessible to the user-id that runs the news system by running
<I>pgp -ka</I> on a file containing the key to add.  For example, at a
site that runs the news server software as <I>news</I>, the following
command run by the <I>news</I> user-id should add the key bounded by
BEGIN and END "PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK" lines in the file <I>/tmp/key</I>
to the default key ring that would be used for authentication:</P>

<PRE>
<I>pgp -ka /tmp/key</I>
</PRE>

<P>As a general policy rule, control message signers will not use their
control message keys to introduce other keys, so when PGP asks you a
question similar to, "Would you trust this user to act as an
introducer and certify other people's public keys to you?" answer that
you would not.</P>

<P>After you have added the appropriate key to your key ring, you need to
tell the news software to validate the control messages received.
As implemented, the system will perform the requested action if the
message can be authenticated and it will mail the message to the news
system administrator if it cannot.  Clearly there are other possible
actions that could be implemented, but I wanted to keep the patches
minimal.  Future releases of the server software will probably have
increased flexibility.</P>

<P>
<UL>
<LI>If you are running INN:

<P>Automatic processing of control messages is handled by
<I>control.ctl</I>, which you edit in the same <I>site</I>
subdirectory where you patched <I>parsecontrol</I>.
<I>control.ctl</I> has several lines at the beginning of it that
describe the format of the file, and there is an even longer
<I>control.ctl(5)</I> manual page.  To enable PGP verification in
addition to the normal authorization done by <I>control.ctl</I>, use
the action <B>verify-<I>pgp_userid</I></B> in the fourth field.
<P>For example, if you trust group-admin@isc.org (currently David
Lawrence &lt;tale@isc.org&gt;, aka tale@uunet.uu.net, the author of
this document) to manage groups in the "Big 8" hierarchies, you could
have lines like these (but don't use the backslash continuation, which
I have used here for readability; keep it all on one line):</P>

<PRE>
newgroup:group-admin@isc.org:\
comp.*|humanities.*|misc.*|news.*|rec.*|sci.*|soc.*|talk.*:\
verify-news.announce.newgroups
rmgroup:group-admin@isc.org:\
comp.*|humanities.*|misc.*|news.*|rec.*|sci.*|soc.*|talk.*:\
verify-news.announce.newgroups
checkgroups:group-admin@isc.org:\
comp.*|humanities.*|misc.*|news.*|rec.*|sci.*|soc.*|talk.*:\
verify-news.announce.newgroups
</PRE>

<P>Additionally, if you like the logging feature available with the
action <B>doit=<I>logfile</I></B>, you can get the same logging 
by using <B>verify-<I>pgp_userid</I>=<I>logfile</I></B>.</P>

<LI>If you are running C News:

<P>Automatic processing of control messages is handled by
<I>controlperm</I>, which you edit in the subdirectory where you
patched the control message handling scripts.  There is a
<I>controlperm(5)</I> manual page that describes its format.  To
enable PGP verification in addition to the normal authorization done
by <I>controlperm</I>, use the action <B>p</B> in the fourth field
instead of <B>y</B> and add a fifth field for the <I>pgp_userid</I>.</P>

<P>For example, if you trust group-admin@isc.org (currently David
Lawrence &lt;tale@isc.org&gt;, aka tale@uunet.uu.net, the author of
this document) to manage groups in the "Big 8" hierarchies, you could
have lines like these (but don't use the backslash continuation, which
I have used here for readability; keep it all on one line):</P>

<PRE>
comp,sci,misc,news,rec,soc,talk group-admin@isc.org nrc pv \
news.announce.newgroups
</PRE>

<P>You could then remove the line that follows the comment, "but his name
can be forged, so don't let him rmgroup..."</P>

<LI>If you are running D News:

<P>Automatic processing of control messages is handled by
<I>control.conf</I>.  To enable PGP verification in addition to the
normal authorization done by <I>control.conf</I>, use the action
<B>pgp</B> in the fourth field, in addition to whatever action you
want to happen.  For example, if you trust group-admin@isc.org
(currently David Lawrence &lt;tale@isc.org&gt;, aka tale@uunet.uu.net,
the author of this document) to manage groups in the "Big 8"
hierarchies, you could have lines like these (but don't use the
backslash continuation, which I have used here for readability; keep
it all on one line):</P>

<PRE>
newgroup:group-admin@isc.org:\
comp.*,misc.*,news.*,rec.*,sci.*,soc.*,talk.*:doit,pgp
rmgroup:group-admin@isc.org:\
omp.*,misc.*,news.*,rec.*,sci.*,soc.*,talk.*:doit,pgp
checkgroups:group-admin@isc.org:\
comp.*,misc.*,news.*,rec.*,sci.*,soc.*,talk.*:doit,pgp
</PRE>

<P>Note that there is no provision, with the current D News
implementation, for checking that the signature matches a particular
string, just that it it has a valid signature.  This is probably
adequate security as long as you keep the news user's PGP key ring
limited only to people you trust to maintain newsgroup hierarchies.</P>

<P>Finally, if you have not installed pgp on your system in a
directory where D News normally looks for auxiliary programs, you will
need to add a pointer to it in <I>dnews.conf</I>, like this:

<PRE>
pgp /path/to/pgp
</PRE>

<P>See
<A HREF="http://www.netwinsite.com/pgp.htm">
http://www.netwinsite.com/pgp.htm</A>
for documentation by the D News authors that might supersede
this document.</P>

<LI>If you are running ANU News (V6.2.0 or later):

<P>Instructions will (hopefully) soon appear here.  In the meantime,
consult the <B>HELP ADD FILE PGP_verification</B> server command.

<LI>If you are running some other system:

<P>You're out of luck until someone writes a patch and instructions for
your system and makes it available to me for redistribution.</P>
</UL>

<LI>
Test the system.

<P>Get
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.isc.org/pub/pgpcontrol/sample.control">
ftp://ftp.isc.org/pub/pgpcontrol/sample.control</A>
and save it to a file on your system; <I>/tmp/sample.control</I> will
be used for this example.  You'll use it to make sure things will work
as expected.</P>

<P>To verify the control message, you will need the 
<A HREF="#comp">key for news.announce.newgroups</A>
and authorization in your news system for group-admin@isc.org to
automatically perform "newgroup".  Go ahead and enable it for the test
even if you don't want to really allow this, because it is easy enough
to rescind after the test by editing the control message authorization
file and removing the key with <I>pgp -kr news.announce.newgroups</I>.</P>

<P>You can check that the <I>pgpverify</I> part of the system will work
properly simply by feeding it the sample control message on stdin:

<PRE>
pgpverify &lt /tmp/sample.control
</PRE>

<P>If if could run pgp and find the correct key in the default key ring,
the string <B>news.announce.newgroups</B> should be printed.  The exit
status of the script, found in most shells with the command <I>echo
$?</I> as the next command after <I>pgpverify</I>, should be 0 (zero).</P>

<P>If it doesn't work, then

<PRE>
pgpverify -test &lt /tmp/sample.control
</PRE>

might give you some enlightment.  It will print out the input that is
used for pgp (which is a reconstructed version of the input that
supposedly created the control message) as well as the output of PGP's
analysis of the message.  Look especially closely at the latter, since
it can give you important information such as which keyring is being
used.</P>

<P>If it still doesn't work and you've tried and tried to figure out why, 
<A HREF="mailto:tale@isc.org (David C Lawrence)">email me</A>
a complete description of the problem you are having and how you have
tried to remedy it.  At a bare minimum, your mail should include a
copy of the message you are trying to verify, a typescript of the
attempted execution of <I>pgpverify -test</I>, and the output of
<I>pgp -kc</I> and <I>pgp -kvc news.announce.newgroups</I>.</P>

<P>When <I>pgpverify</I> passes its test, use the appropriate procedure
below for you news server to verify the authorization system.</P>

<P>
<UL>
<LI>If you are running INN:

<P>First, cd to the directory where <I>parsecontrol</I> is installed.
Then execute the following four lines, in order, as the user who owns
the news system:</P>

<PRE>
/bin/sh
PROG=newgroup
set "--" group-admin@isc.org "" /tmp/sample.control
(. ./parsecontrol "$@"; echo $ACTION)
</PRE>

<P>If the message verified correctly, the <I>echo</I> command should
output <B>doit</B>; otherwise, verification failed and the output
should be <B>mail</B>.</P>

<P>Edit <I>/tmp/sample.control</I> and change all occurences of
<B>newusers</B> to <B>newgroups</B>.  Then repeat the
<I>parsecontrol</I> and <I>echo</I> lines.  This time verification
should fail.</P>

<LI>If you are running C News:

<P>Because of the way C News is implemented, I have not taken the trouble
to find out how it can be tested without running through the whole
<I>newgroup</I> script.  If you are testing with <I>sample.control</I>,
I think this should let you know whether things will work:</P>

<PRE>
newsflag news.announce.newusers y
newgroup news.announce.newusers moderated &lt /tmp/sample.control
</PRE>

<P>(newsflag is the C News program <I>maint</I> subdirectory; newgroup is
in the <I>ctl</I> subdirectory.)</P>

<P>You should get a mail message telling you that news.announce.newusers
was changed to moderated.  If it didn't appear to work, doublecheck
the <I>active</I> file.  If it really didn't work, fix the status of
the group with the following command then let me know about.</P>

<PRE>
newsflag news.announce.newusers m
</PRE>

<P>If the message did verify correctly, edit <I>/tmp/sample.control</I>
and change all occurences of <B>newusers</B> to <B>newgroups</B>.
Then repeat the <I>newgroup</I> line with an <B>unmoderated</B>
argument instead of <B>moderated</B>; the argument is unused in the
PGP verification code and doing it this way saves you the effort of
<I>newsflag</I>ging things again.</P>

<P>With the changes to <I>sample.control</I> you should now get a mail
message saying, "authentication failed".</P>

<P>When you are all done, make sure news.announce.newusers is really
marked moderated in your <I>active</I> file.</P>

<LI>If you are running D News:

<P>It appears to me that currently you'll have to wait for a control
message to come in and see whether it does what you want.  If it
doesn't, and you can't readily tell why, contact D News's customer
support staff.</P>

<LI>If you are running ANU News (V6.2.0 or later):

<P>Instructions will (hopefully) soon appear here.  In the meantime,
consult the <B>HELP ADD FILE PGP_verification</B> server command.</P>

<LI>If you are running some other system:

<P>You're out of luck until someone writes a patch and instructions for
your system and makes it available to me for redistribution.</P>
</UL>
</OL>

<H2>Format of Signed Control Messages</H2>

<P>The format of the input to PGP for signing and verifying messages
is described in a separate document,
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.isc.org/pub/pgpcontrol/FORMAT">
ftp://ftp.isc.org/pub/pgpcontrol/FORMAT</A>.
It is intended for people who want to implement their own signing
and/or verifying programs instead of using pgpverify or signcontrol.</P>

<H2>Frequently Asked Questions</H2>

<OL>
<H3><LI>How come this presumably valid messages doesn't check out with
pgpverify?</H3>

<UL>
<LI>You don't have the latest version of <I>pgpverify</I>, which fixed
whatever bug is causing authentication of the message to fail.
<LI>You don't have your PGP configuration files and keyrings in the
default path used by <I>pgp</I> and <B>PGPPATH</B> is not correctly
set in your environment.  Either move your PGP directory to the
default location or set the <B>$ENV{'PGPPATH'}</B> line in <I>pgpverify</I>.
(Warning: some INN versions set <B>$HOME</B> to <B>_PATH_NEWSLIB</B>,
so this might be the source of your trouble.)
<LI>You don't have the correct key for the user that signed it in your
key ring.
<LI>You are using a non-English version of <I>pgp</I>, set up with
a "<B>Language</B> = " line in your PGP <I>config.txt</I> file.  This
means pgpverify can't find the string it is looking for in
the <I>pgp</I> output.  <I>pgpverify</I> tries to overcome a non-English
language specification by setting <B>LANGUAGE</B> in the 
environment before calling <I>pgp</I>, but <I>pgp</I> overrides the
runtime environment with the <I>config.txt</I> variables.
<LI>You cut-and-pasted the message in your window system, which
converted the tab characters in the original message into spaces in
the message you are trying to decode.  Having this handled completely
correctly by the signing/verifying code is harder than you might first
think.
<LI>You are running <I>pgpverify</I> on a saved
copy of the article that includes an extraneous trailing newline, such
as might be inserted by saving the message from a mail handler or news
reader, that was not present in the original message. 
<LI>You cut-and-pasted the sample INN <I>control.ctl</I> lines above
and left the continuation lines in, instead of joining each group of
three physical lines comprising one logical line to just one physical line.

<H2><A NAME="Keys">List of PGP Public Keys for Newsgroup Administration</A></H2>

<P>This is a list of keys known to be used for maintaining various parts
of the newsgroup namespace.  They are listed alphabetically by the
hierarchies they are used for, along with the email address they are
sent by and the pgp key userid of the signature (both for use in
<I>control.ctl</I>).  The group that people should follow if they are
interested in tracking announcements about the hierarchy is also
listed.  The "Check also" references point to locations that should
have identical public key blocks; it is best if you confirm the block
listed here by checking against the others.</P>

<P>The existence of key here only means that I, David Lawrence, trust the
person who uses it to be a responsible maintainer of that particular
hierarchy of groups.  You are solely responsible for deciding whether
you will use the keys here at your own site.</P>
