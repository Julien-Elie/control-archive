                      Control Processing To-Do List

Processing:

 * Control messages in unmanaged hierarchies (alt.*, free.*) should really
   be throttled somehow to deal with floods of useless newsgroup
   creations.  It's not clear how best to do the throttling, though (what
   headers to look at, what rate at which to throttle, and how to
   configure it).  The need for this seems to have decreased lately.

 * process-control should support using sm to retrieve the article if
   instead of a path it gets a storage API token.  This would let it run
   as a channel feed from a current innd.

 * Support chkscope in checkgroups message from new USEPRO draft.

 * Support checkgroups serial numbers from new USEPRO draft.

 * Support message/news-groupinfo in newgroup control messages.  This
   requires parsing the MIME structure of the message (probably using one
   of the Perl MIME parsing libraries) and looking for a part of type
   application/news-groupinfo, and then checking its charset as well as
   parsing it.

 * Support an optional strongly-conforming mode which requires the tab in
   newsgroup descriptions and doesn't archive messages that aren't fully
   compliant with the current standards.

Configuration:

 * If PGP-enabled hierarchies marked PRIVATE included the verification
   configuration lines commented-out, cl.* and ka.* could be handled
   without special fragments.

 * If there were a way to add special rules for particular group patterns
   within the hierarchy, carleton.*, git.*, israel.*, iu.*, umn.*, and
   utexas.* could be handled without special fragments.

 * If there were a way to add extended comments to an entry in the regular
   config syntax, fa.*, local.*, and microsoft.* could be handled without
   special fragments.

Output:

 * Currently, the generated newsgroups file uses the traditional mixed
   encoding, where each hierarchy's descriptions are encoded in whatever
   local character set that hierarchy happens to use.  This means that the
   file itself has no single valid encoding.  Incoming control messages
   should be parsed for a character set and then newsgroup descriptions
   converted to UTF-8 so that a consistent UTF-8 newsgroups file can be
   generated.

   Julien Ã‰LIE collected the following information about character sets
   for newsgroup descriptions in existing hierarchies:

   - cn.* and han.* are in gb18030.
   - fido7.*, medlux.*, and ukr.* are in cp1251.
   - fr.* is in cp1252 but will be iso-8859-15.
   - nctu.*, ncu.*, and tw.* are in big5 but tw.* has a bad group.
   - scout.forum.{chinese,korean} are in big5.
   - fido.* is in utf-8.

   Interpreting everything else as cp1252 seems to work currently.

 * Generate control.conf (for DNews) and controlperm (for C News) output
   files as well.

 * Defunct hierarchies should not be listed in the regular control.ctl
   when they've been defunct for more than six months or a year.  They
   should instead be moved to something like docs/hierarchies, but that
   file should be easily parsable.

 * Add a separate RESERVED status for things like local.*, test.*,
   and example.*.

Documentation:

 * The template for README.html hasn't been looked at in years, has
   David's e-mail address as the contact information, and is probably
   hopelessly out of date in other respects.  It's also a bit odd to put
   all the PGP keys into an HTML file.  It should be rewritten from
   scratch to include currently relevant information, probably moved into
   the pgpcontrol package instead of maintained here, and just reference
   the text PGPKEYS file.

 * The format of the PGPKEYS file is a left-over from when it was
   generated from README.html using lynx -dump (after README.html was
   manually updated).  There are certainly better formats that could be
   used, and it would be nice to include the gpg -k --fingerprint output
   for each key before the key for the benefit of human readers.
   Currently some keys have that in their included text file and others
   don't.

 * docs/hierarchies is fairly obsolete.  Maintaining it is probably more
   work still than anyone wants to go to, at least to the degree that it
   used to be maintained, but it needs an editing pass to remove
   information that only duplicates the current control.ctl file or which
   is obviously no longer correct.
