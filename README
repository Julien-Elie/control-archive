The files in this directory are used to generate control.ctl for both the
INN distribution and for ftp.isc.org, and the PGPKEYS and README.html
files for /pub/usenet/CONFIG on ftp.isc.org.  This process is at present
semi-automated; scripts in this directory will automate the process of
putting together those files, but installing them is currently done by
hand.

The configuration data is in one file per hierarchy in the config/
directory.  Each file has the format specified in FORMAT and is designed
to be readable by INN's new configuration parser in case this can be
further automated down the road.  The config/special/ directory contains
overrides, raw control.ctl fragments that should be used for particular
hierarchies instead of automatically-generated entries (usually for
special comments).

The keys/ directory contains the PGP public keys for every hierarchy that
has one.  Generally there's some introductory text giving the key ID and
user ID.

The forms/ directory contains the basic file structure for the three
generated files.

To generate files from the configuration data and keys, first create a
GnuPG keyring containing all of the keys in the directory keyring (which
isn't part of CVS).  You can do this with:

    mkdir keyring
    gpg --homedir=keyring --import keys/*

Then, run ./generate-files.  This should result in PGPKEYS, README.html,
and control.ctl in the current directory.

control.ctl should be checked in to the samples/ directory of the INN CVS
repository on all active branches (or the INN maintainers asked to do this
if the control files are being maintained by people other than INN
maintainers).

Each of these files should also be updated in /news/local on isrv4.isc.org
(control.ctl.netwide is what control.ctl is called there).  To do this,
first lock each file with:

    co -l control.ctl.netwide README.html PGPKEYS

then copy the new files over, and finally check them in with:

    ci -u control.ctl.netwide README.html PGPKEYS

with some suitable commit message.

Updates to hierarchy control information is generally either posted to
news.admin.hierarchies or mailed to usenet-config@isc.org.  There is a FAQ
at <http://www.eyrie.org/~eagle/faqs/usenet-hier.html>.
