                   User-Visible control-archive Changes

control-archive 1.3.0 (unreleased)

    Special-case public hierarchies with no control message senders and
    add a comment saying that the hierarchy is in use, but has no active
    maintainer.

    When generating PGPKEYS and README.html, allow for the possibility of
    having no control message senders for abandoned hierarchies.

    The key fingerprint pseudo-header in control.ctl entries now matches
    the syntax of the other pseudo-headers, using a colon instead of an
    equal sign.

    * Update description for belwue.* to be more correct
    * Add contact, URL, and fingerprint for belwue.*

control-archive 1.2.0 (2009-12-29)

    When generating a control message report with exclusions, don't send
    the report if all actions during the time period were excluded.

    Add better debugging to control-summary for failure to load the
    template and failure to connect to an NNTP server.

    Install the control-report template on make install.

    Hierarchy updates:

    * Fix pubnet.* URL into the control archive
    * Remove sdnet.* configuration, document in docs/hierarchies
    * Add eternal-september.* from http://www.eternal-september.org/

control-archive 1.1.0 (2009-01-02)

    In update-control bulkload, accept tabs in newsgroup descriptions and
    change them to spaces.  Tabs are not permitted in the current grammar
    for newsgroup lines or in the upcoming USEPRO standard, but better to
    be liberal when importing from older sources.

    Fix missing variable declaration in process-control and
    update-control.

    Add an install target to the Makefile and updated the installation
    documentation to use it.  The default Makefile target now just builds
    control.ctl rather than building a distribution.

    Change CVS to Subversion in the control.ctl reference to the INN
    version control repository.

    Hierarchy updates:

    * Add grisbi.* from http://news.grisbi.org/
    * Update gnuu.* from http://www.gnuu.de/config/
    * Document um.* removal in docs/hierarchies

control-archive 1.0.0 (2008-11-08)

    Initial public release.
