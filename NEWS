                   User-Visible control-archive Changes

control-archive 1.1.0 (2009-01-02)

    In update-control bulkload, accept tabs in newsgroup descriptions and
    change them to spaces.  Tabs are not permitted in the current grammar
    for newsgroup lines or in the upcoming USEPRO standard, but better to
    be liberal when importing from older sources.

    Fix missing variable declaration in process-control and
    update-control.

    Added an install target to the Makefile and updated the installation
    documentation to use it.  The default Makefile target now just builds
    control.ctl rather than building a distribution.

    Changed CVS to Subversion in the control.ctl reference to the INN
    version control repository.

    Hierarchy updates:

    * Added grisbi.* from http://news.grisbi.org/
    * Updated gnuu.* from http://www.gnuu.de/config/
    * Documented um.* removal in docs/hierarchies

control-archive 1.0.0 (2008-11-08)

    Initial public release.
