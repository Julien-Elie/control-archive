                   User-Visible control-archive Changes

control-archive 1.2.0 (unreleased)

    Add better debugging to control-summary for failure to load the
    template and failure to connect to an NNTP server.

    Install the control-report template on make install.

    Hierarchy updates:

    * Fix pubnet.* URL into the control archive
    * Remove sdnet.* configuration, document in docs/hierarchies
    * Update the ba.* key ID to match the configuration
    * Add eternal-september.* from http://www.eternal-september.org/
    * Add szaf.* (private)
    * Update sender for opennews.*
    * Update admin group for cl.*
    * Update URL for hun.*
    * Update URL and add syncable server for nlo.*

control-archive 1.1.0 (2009-01-02)

    In update-control bulkload, accept tabs in newsgroup descriptions and
    change them to spaces.  Tabs are not permitted in the current grammar
    for newsgroup lines or in the upcoming USEPRO standard, but better to
    be liberal when importing from older sources.

    Fix missing variable declaration in process-control and
    update-control.

    Add an install target to the Makefile and updated the installation
    documentation to use it.  The default Makefile target now just builds
    control.ctl rather than building a distribution.

    Change CVS to Subversion in the control.ctl reference to the INN
    version control repository.

    Hierarchy updates:

    * Add grisbi.* from http://news.grisbi.org/
    * Update gnuu.* from http://www.gnuu.de/config/
    * Document um.* removal in docs/hierarchies

control-archive 1.0.0 (2008-11-08)

    Initial public release.
