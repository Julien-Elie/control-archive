Approved: rra@stanford.edu

Over the past week, the following changes have been made to the list of
Usenet newsgroups maintained at <ftp://ftp.isc.org/pub/usenet/CONFIG/>.
This list is maintained via automatic processing of control messages as
explained by the files in that directory.  For more information, see the
end of this message.

{$report}
                      ------------------------------

This report contains all changes to managed newsgroup hierarchies for
which there are control message processing rules in the control.ctl file
at:

    <ftp://ftp.isc.org/pub/usenet/CONFIG/control.ctl>

The control messages are processed according to the rules specified in:

    <ftp://ftp.isc.org/pub/usenet/CONFIG/README>

"Managed" in the above means that changes to alt.* and free.* are
specifically excluded from this report (but included in the maintained
newsgroup lists) because there is too much churn in those hierarchies and
too much noise in the report.  Similar unmanaged hierarchies may be
excluded in the future, should they cause similar problems.  This report
will not be modified to include alt.* and free.*, but anyone else who
wishes could produce a more inclusive report from the log files in:

    <ftp://ftp.isc.org/pub/usenet/CONFIG/LOGS/>

It is the intent of this archive and report to include every public Usenet
hierarchy for which verifiable control messages are sent.  If you know of
a public Usenet hierarchy which is not represented in this report or in
the Usenet newsgroup lists and have the details on how to validate control
messages for that hierarchy, please mail usenet-config@isc.org and let us
know the details.  (If no control messages are being issued for that
hierarchy, someone should start!)

If you have any other questions about this report after reading the README
file mentioned above, please mail usenet-config@isc.org.
