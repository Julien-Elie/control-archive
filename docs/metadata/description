This package contains two major components:

* All of the configuration used to generate the `control.ctl` file
  distributed from ftp.isc.org and included in INN and the `PGPKEYS` and
  `README.html` files distributed with pgpcontrol, along with the script
  to generate those files.  This information is used to maintain the
  ftp.isc.org list of active newsgroups.

* The software used to process control messages, verifying them against
  that authorization information, and maintain a control message archive
  and list of active newsgroups.  Software is also included to generate
  reports of recent changes to the list of active newsgroups.

Manual changes to the canonical newsgroup list are also supported, in a
way that generates the same log messages and uses the same locking
structure so that they can co-exist with automated changes and be included
in the same reports.  Also included in this package are the documentation
files included in the control message archive and newsgroup lists on
ftp.isc.org.
