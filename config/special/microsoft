# Broken control messages for the Microsoft groups are sent from the
# address pssolops@microsoft.com, but they aren't signed and don't contain
# valid newsgroup file entries.  It is therefore recommended to use
# actsync rather than control message processing to maintain one's local
# list of microsoft.* groups if you carry this hierarchy.
