## IT-ALT (Alternate Italian)
#
# There is no one official control message issuer for the it-alt.*
# hierarchy, so this file doesn't choose any particular one.  Several
# different people issue control messages for this hierarchy, which may
# or may not agree, and sites carrying this hierarchy are encouraged to
# pick one and add it below.
#
# Newgroup and removal requests are to be posted to it-alt.config.  A list
# of people issuing PGP/GPG signed control messages is available in a
# periodic posting to news.admin.hierarchies and it-alt.config.
