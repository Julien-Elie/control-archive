## ALT
#
# Accept all newgroups (except ones forged from Big 8 newgroup issuers,
# who never issue alt.* control messages) and silently ignore all
# rmgroups.  This file used to attempt to track and recommend trusted
# rmgroup issuers, but this idea is now obsolete.  What policy to use for
# alt.* groups varies widely from site to site.  For a small site, it is
# strongly recommended that this policy be changed to drop all newgroups
# for alt.* as well as rmgroups and that the news admin only add new alt.*
# groups on request, as tons of alt.* newgroups are sent out regularly
# with the intent more to create nonsense entries in active files than to
# actually create a useable newsgroup.
#
# Be aware that there is no official, generally accepted alt.* policy and
# all information about alt.* groups available is essentially someone's
# opinion, including these comments.  There are nearly as many different
# policies with regard to alt.* groups as there are Usenet sites.
