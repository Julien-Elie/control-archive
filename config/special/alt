## ALT
#
# Accept all newgroups (except ones forged from Big 8 newgroup issuers,
# who never issue alt.* control messages) and silently ignore all
# rmgroups.
#
# What policy to use for alt.* groups varies widely from site to site.
# For a small site, it is strongly recommended that this policy be changed
# to drop all newgroups and rmgroups for alt.*.  The local news admin can
# then add new alt.* groups only on user request.  Tons of alt.* newgroups
# are sent out regularly with the intent more to create nonsense entries
# in active files than to actually create a useable newsgroup.  The admin
# may still want to check the control message archive, as described below.
#
# Quality, user-desirable new groups can often be discovered by a quick
# perusal of recent alt.* newgroup messages after discarding obvious junk
# groups.  One good initial filter is to check the archive of control
# messages for a requested group to see if a syntactically valid newgroup
# message was issued.  Many of the junk control messages are invalid and
# won't be archived, and many sites will only add alt.* groups with valid
# control messages.  To check the archive, see if:
#
#     ftp://ftp.isc.org/pub/usenet/control/alt/<group-name>.gz
#
# exists (replacing <group-name> with the name of the group) and read the
# first and last few control messages to see if the newsgroup should be
# moderated.  (Some alt.* groups that should be moderated are created
# unmoderated by hijackers to try to damage the newsgroup.)
#
# Be aware that there is no official, generally accepted alt.* policy and
# all information about alt.* groups available is essentially someone's
# opinion, including these comments.  There are nearly as many different
# policies with regard to alt.* groups as there are Usenet sites.
