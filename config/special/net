## NET (*HISTORIC* -- Usenet 2)
#
# This was a failed experiment in a different newsgroup creation policy and
# administrative policy which has now been almost entirely abandoned.  The
# information is retained here for the few sites still using it, but sites
# not already carrying the groups probably won't be interested.
#
# (This was also the original unmoderated Usenet hierarchy from before the
# Great Renaming.  The groups that used to be in net.* in the 1980s are now
# in the Big Eight hierarchies.)
