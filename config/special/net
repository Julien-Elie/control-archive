## NET (*HISTORIC* -- Usenet 2)
#
# This was a failed experiment in a different newsgroup creation policy and
# administrative policy which has now been abandoned.
#
# (This was also the original unmoderated Usenet hierarchy from before the
# Great Renaming.  The groups that used to be in net.* in the 1980s are now
# in the Big Eight hierarchies.)
