description: Special hierarchy for UUCP point-to-point messages
groups: to.*
comment: [
    "Historically, the to.* hierarchy was used with UUCP to send special"
    "control messages to a particular peer.  This usage is very obsolete,"
    "but the hierarchy is still special-cased in some news software and"
    "should not be used."
