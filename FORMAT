This is the format for the configuration files in config (excluding the
special files in config/special, which are used verbatim).  The
configuration files are read by scripts/generate-files.

hierarchy: (abbreviated hierarchy name, all caps)
type: [ public | private | local | defunct | historic ]
description: (short English description)
groups: (shell case pattern for hierarchy)
sender: (vector of patterns matching control message sender)
newgroup-sender: (vector of patterns matching newgroup sender)
rmgroup-sender: (vector of patterns matching rmgroup sender)
checkgroups-sender: (vector of patterns matching checkgroups sender)
contact: (vector of contact addresses)
url: (hierarchy URL)
pgp: [ yes | no ]
non-pgp-drop: [ yes | no ]
key-id: (user ID of PGP key)
key-url: (URL for PGP key for hierarchy)
key-fingerprint: (fingerprint of PGP key)
sync-server: (news server allowing LIST)

This format cannot handle different rules for particular sub-hierarchies
without giving them entirely separate entries, and the actions are
determined by the hierarchy type.  It also doesn't have a way of adding an
extended comment description some special situation for a hierarchy.
Those restrictions are the reason for many of the special entries.
